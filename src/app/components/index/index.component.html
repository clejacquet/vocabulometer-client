        <p>Hello! This is your first time in Vocabulometer, so we need to know a bit more about you before letting you
          use our learning services. </p>
        <p>This platform uses your English vocabulary to recommend texts that correspond to your level. Yet as you are
        a new user we have no information about your vocabulary!</p>

        <p>Vocabulometer offers you two options to solve this issue. Either solve a quiz that will determine your level,
        or give your CEFR level or TOEIC / TOEFL / IELTS score if you passed any of these tests.</p>

        <p>Please select one of the two options.</p>
